# Mario Rolling Sky 3D Game

(Catalan version in [README.md](README.md))

In this repository, you can find the implementation and documentation of a Unity 3D game that aims to be a tribute to the popular Rolling Sky game combined with the Mario universe.

## Authors and Context

This project has been developed by users [@arnauarque](https://github.com/arnauarque) and [@danielesquina](https://github.com/danielesquina) as part of the [Video Games](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica/pla-destudis/assignatures/VJ) subject of the [Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica) at the Faculty of Informatics of Barcelona (Polytechnic University of Catalonia).

## Repository Organization

- The directory [MarioRollingSky](game/MarioRollingSky) contains the Unity project (version 2019.2.11f1) with the necessary scripts, models, and prefabs, among others, for editing or previewing the game.
- The file [report_en.pdf](reports/report_en.pdf) contains a report that outlines the objectives, motivation, methodology, and conclusions of the project. Additionally, it includes a detailed description of the objectives, instructions, and the process of creating the 3D models (tiles, entities, functionalities, etc.) of the game.
- An [Package](game/MarioRollingSkyMac.app) compatible with macOS Ventura is included, containing a functional version of the game.
- Finally, we have added a [video](others/demo.avi) as a preview and demonstration of the functionality of the final version of the video game.

## Additional Comments
